- Save a synchronized list of recommended enhancements (data enrichment, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, deployment) mapped to project description and guidelines.

3. **Notebook 1 Expansion Guide**  

- Detail concrete actions to extend `01_EDA.ipynb` for:  
- Merging IPEDS, Federal Student Aid, and Census data via OPEID/UNITID.
